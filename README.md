```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev

## 🚀 Branching Model

We follow the **GitHub Flow** branching model to ensure a simple and efficient development process.

### 🌿 Branches

- **`main`** – Always **stable** and ready for deployment.
- **Feature branches** – Created from `main` for new features or fixes (`it21210174-VR-Feature `, `it21321368-Travel-Assistant`, `it21285042-Cousine-Hub`).

### 🔄 Workflow

#### 1️⃣ Create a Feature Branch, Make Changes, Commit, and Push  
Create a new branch from `main` for your feature or bug fix, make your changes, commit them, and push the branch to the repository.  
```sh
git checkout -b feature-branch-name      # Create a new feature branch

git add .                                # Stage changes
git commit -m "Description of changes"    # Commit changes with a message

git push origin feature-branch-name       # Push the branch to remote repository
```
### 2️⃣ Open a Pull Request 
Open a Pull Request  on GitHub.
Request a review and make necessary changes.

### 3️⃣ Merge into main After Approval
```sh
git checkout main
git merge feature-branch-name
git push origin main
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
